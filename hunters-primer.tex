\chapter{Hunter's Arsenal}
To overcome the many monsters that inhabit the wilderness, hunters rely on a variety of different weapons and tools that give them an edge over the bigger, faster and stronger monsters.

In addition to the equipment here, an often underappreciated item in the hunter's arsenal is information. Through observation, a group of hunter can study the weaknesses of a monster before facing it.

\section{Weapons}
The Guild has a range of suggestions for hunter on a variety of weapons to use. While they recommend the use of one of these weapons, they are not all that is available. Some of these differ from the \PHB{} or are completely new. All weapons are martial weapons unless designated simple.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/sword-and-shield-white}{Sword \& Shield}{Damage, cost and weight vary}
A common, fast, bread-and-butter combination ideal for many hunters who choose to travel light, but do not want to sacrifice defensive potential. Typical sword choices are the longsword or rapier from the \PHB.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/dual-blades-white}{Dual Blades}{Damage, cost and weight vary}
Hunters wishing for more fast damage output at the cost of defence sometimes choose to wield two blades. One advantage of dual wielding is being able to utilise two different special weapon properties. Typical choices of swords are the scimitars and/or shortswords from the \PHB.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/great-sword-white}{Great Sword}{1d12 slashing, 50gp, 30lb., Heavy, two-handed}
A truly colossal weapon, the Great Sword swings slow but hits hard. A well-placed hit from this weapon can deal devastating damage. It is the same as the greataxe from the Player's Handbook.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/long-sword-white}{Long Sword}{1d10 slashing, 20gp, 18lb., Heavy, reach, two-handed}
Not to be confused with the longsword from the \PHB, the Long Sword is a typically curved sword about 6 feet long. The key to mastering it is positioning yourself to strike with the strongest part of the blade for best damage. Any character who is proficient with greatswords is also proficient with the Long Sword.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/hammer-white}{Hammer}{2d6 bludgeoning, 10gp., 30lb. Heavy, Two-handed}
A weapon with similar weight as the Great Sword, it brings this weight to bear directly as blunt damage. It is the same as the maul from the Player's Handbook.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/hunting-horn-white}{Hunting Horn}{1d8 bludgeoning, 5gp, 20lb., Heavy, two-handed, Simple}
The Hunting Horn encompasses a class of blunt melee weapons with a musical instrument built in, usually a horn or bagpipes. To use it as a weapon, one has to be proficient with greatclubs. To use it as a musical instrument, one must be proficient with the instrument that is built in. A popular choice for bard hunters.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/insect-glaive-white}{Glaive}{1d6 slashing, 40gp, 8lb., Double}
A Ranger specialty, the Glaive is a double-ended weapon. Wielding it is similar to dual wielding two light weapons and requires two hands (though the two attacks are one-handed). Rangers are proficient with the Glaive. It is traditional to keep an insect animal companion (a kinsect) in addition to wielding this weapon, leading to its more common name: Insect Glaive.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/lance-white}{Lance}{1d8 piercing, 10gp, 12lb., Reach, special, versatile (1d10)}
The Lance is a weapon intended for use on foot and optimized for charging. Attacks you make with a Lance against targets 5 feet away have disadvantage. If you have the Charger feat, you may choose to both shove and attack when you take advantage of the feat.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/gunlance-white}{Gunlance}{1d6 slashing, 15gp, 18lb., Heavy, ammunition (range 30/90), special}
The Gunlance is a fusion of melee and ranged weapon but it can also use its shelling capacity to augment melee attacks. When used for a ranged attack, it deals 1d4 piercing damage. When hitting with a melee attack, the wielder may use a bonus action to make a ranged attack with advantage against the target of the melee attack (ignoring the usual penalty for using a ranged weapon within 5 feet of the target).

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/switch-axe-white}{Switch Axe}{1d8 slashing, 25gp, 24lb., Heavy, two-handed, versatile (1d10), special}
The Switch Axe can toggle between two modes: sword mode and axe mode. In sword mode, the axe head is used as a shield (for the usual shield benefit). In axe mode, the weapon is a two-handed greataxe. Switching between the modes is a bonus action. Its main drawback is that the shield is integrated with the weapon and cannot be replaced with a magically enhanced one.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/light-bowgun-white}{Light Bowgun}{1d6 piercing, 25gp, 8lb., Ammunition (range 80/320), simple}
Similar to a crossbow, but firing crude gunpowder shots and with a special loading mechanism, the Bowgun represents the state of the art of hunter weaponry. Stats-wise, it is equivalent to the shortbow from the \PHB.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/heavy-bowgun-white}{Heavy Bowgun}{1d10 piercing, 50gp, 25lb., Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, two-handed, loading, special}
The Heavy Bowgun is very unwieldy when used while mobile. As a bonus action, you can set down or pick up the Heavy Bowgun. You may only do this if you do not move on that turn. While manning the deployed Bowgun, you are immobile (gaining the grappled condition) and the weapon loses the loading property.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/bow-white}{Bow}{1d8 piercing, 40gp, 6lb., Ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed}
The Bow is the ranged weapon of choice when wishing for a heavy weapon without sacrificing mobility. It is the same as the longbow from the \PHB.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/boomerang-white}{Boomerang}{1d4 bludgeoning, 2gp, 1lb., Thrown (range 20/60), simple}
A weapon favoured by Lynians, the Boomerang is a thrown weapon that can be surprisingly deadly if thrown by a skilled fighter. If you have proficiency, the Boomerang returns to you and can be thrown again next round. If you are able to make multiple attacks, you must carry that many Boomerangs.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/blunt-white}{Felyne Catspaw}{1d8 bludgeoning, 1gp, 8lb., Two-Handed, simple}
A traditional Felyne weapon, often wielded by Melynx. It is similar to a mace where the head is a large stylised catspaw.

\section{Heavy Weapons}

Many installations built to defend against monster attacks, as well as many sand-, water- or airships have built-in stationary heavy weapons. While cumbersome to operate, these pack more of a punch than any weapon that can be carried. These weapons can turn the tide even in a fight against the mighty Elder Dragons.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/ammo-white}{Ballista}{range 120/480 ft., 3d10 piercing}
A common heavy weapon due to its light weight and great versatility. It usually has a wide firing arc, but comparatively low damage. It takes an action to load and an action to fire, though they need not be carried out by the same person. Due to its light build, a ballista is fairly easily destroyed, should it be hit by a stray fireball.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/ammo-yellow}{Ballista Binder}{range 80/320 ft., special}
A special type of ammo that can be shot from almost any ballista. The point of this type of shot is not to wound, but to entangle the monster and make it vulnerable to other attacks. Treat this as the restrained condition. If the monster was flying when it was hit, it now falls to the ground. On subsequent turns/actions, it can struggle against the bindings.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/ammo-red}{Cannon}{range 300/1,200 ft., 8d10 bludgeoning}
The usual choice for heavy bombardment. These weapons are best operated by multiple people as it takes at an action to load it (in addition to fetching the ammunition) and one to fire it. They are usually mounted in a fixed direction and cannot be aimed. However, their high damage makes up for their cumbersome nature.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/coin-white}{The Dragonator}{reach 20 ft., 10d10 piercing, double damage against dragons}
The Dragonator is the most destructive weapon ever designed in the fight against monsters. Developed at a time of great crisis, it has singlehandedly turned fights against the Elder Dragons in the humans' favour. It is always mounted in a fixed position and its spring-loaded construction is triggered at a seperate switch. It is useful against any kind of monster, but the magic with which its metal construction is infused makes it particularly effective against dragons.

The fact that the Hunters' Guild condones the use of this weapon is not without controversy. It is a vile weapon, designed to inflict cruel and debilitating wounds in order to cause a dragon (its intended target) to flee. In addition, the magical enchantments placed on each Dragonator are fueled from a deep hatred for the dragons and the terror they represent. This is in contrast to the Guild's founding principle of \emph{respect for nature}. However, the use of the Dragonator has proven necessary again and again when cities and caravans were threatened by the seemingly invincible Elder Dragons. At least, its use against non-dragons is discouraged.


\section{Tools}
In addition to causing damage, a variety of other effects can be achieved with a clever application of available materials. This list is by no means exhaustive and hunters are always encouraged to attempt new tricks to give them an edge against a monster.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/sac-purple}{Poison}{}
There are many different poisonous plants and mushrooms, as well as venomous monsters. Poison can be applied in various ways, whether by making tinged meat~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/meat-purple}, applying it to your weapons, making poisoned daggers~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/knife-purple} or spreading it as a cloud with a poison smoke bomb~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/smoke-purple}. Keep in mind however, that as many of the monsters that hunters often face are quite large, they will usually need more than one application of poison for it to be effective.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/trap-blue}{Traps}{Usually pitfall~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/trap-green} or shock~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/trap-purple} traps}
The purpose of a trap is to temporarily immobilise a monster to make it vulnerable to attacks or prevent it from attacking. Usually, a trap will not be able to contain a large monster for a long time, so it would be wise to make good use of the time bought.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/monster-jewel-yellow}{Flash \& Sonic Bombs}{} Faster to apply but also shorter in effect than traps are flash~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/monster-jewel-yellow} and sonic~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/monster-jewel-grey} bombs. They can be thrown like grenades and will explode for the desired effect. Proper research on the monster can determine which type of bomb is effective and when it is best used, as timing is of the essence with bombs. Just make sure your fellow hunters are safe!

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/dung}{Dung Bombs}{}
On the defensive side, a popular option for getting out of a tight spot is the timely application of a dung bomb. Many monsters will let even a tasty hunter slip through their fingers when confronted with a steaming pile of poo to the face. Again, research is important as not every monster will react the same and it would be a shame if this plan would blow up in your face\ldots

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/smoke-white}{Smoke Bombs}{}
Whether to make a quick escape or a covert entrance, smoke bombs can give concealment but can also be suspicious if used incorrectly. Using an action, it fills a sphere with a 20 foot radius with a thick fog cloud. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 5 minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/barrel-bomb-red}{Barrel Bombs}{2d10 (small) or 4d10 (large) bludgeoning}
Considered crude by some hunters, the barrel bomb still remains a staple in the hunter's arsenal since the invention of gunpowder. Due to the unreliability of fuses, usually only the small variants~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/barrel-bomb-yellow} include fuses, the large ones need to be triggered in other ways.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/horn-yellow}{Magic Horns}{}
These magically enchanted horns can be blown as an action and apply their effect to all friendly creatures within 100 feet who can hear it. The typical application is a healing horn~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/horn-green}, but other variants are possible. Horns use up their magic after their first use and are just mundane horns afterwards.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/meat-orange}{Meat}{}
Choosing the location of the battle in your favour can make the difference between a successful hunt and a terrible failure. Baiting a monster with its preferred food is a popular way of making sure the fight happens on your terms. Once again, research is key to determine what food the monster prefers.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/book-blue}{Information}{}
From all these entries it should be obvious that knowing is half the battle. Observing the monster~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/binoculars} or studying available texts about it is the way to find out which tricks work, and which tricks won't.


\section{Loot}

Besides knowing that the village is safe again, there is a variety of useful materials to be gained from the slain monsters themselves. Many parts of a monster can be put to good use. Here's what to watch out for:

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/bone-white}{Bones}{}
Many monsters have particularly hard bones which are doubly useful in that they can be used to make weapons \emph{and} armor, as well as tools. Useful bones are usually obtained from beasts and leviathans---wyverns, especially flying and bird wyverns have fairly lightweight bones that are not as useful.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/scale-green}{Scales}{Or shells~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/shell-green} or carapaces~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/carapace-green}}
Wyverns in particular have hardened scales that are their primary protection. They are highly useful for armorcrafting. Scales come in all shapes and sizes, but usually, only the hardest and largest scales are useful, which do not always survive the fight undamaged. Other monsters have hardened exoskeletons, which are easier to obtain but usually make the monster very hard to kill. The rarest scales are so-called plates~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/scale-yellow} or mantles~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/mantle-yellow}. They make the best armor material, but are very difficult to carve. Scales, carapaces and plates are usually used to make medium or heavy armor.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/hide-pink}{Hides}{Or webbing~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/webbing-pink}}
For crafting lighter armor, hard and heavy materials such as bones and scales are less useful than the lighter hides of beasts or webbings of winged monsters. Of these, hides are more commonly used for armor, as webbing is often more useful for the manufacture of magic items. However, webbing can also be used in armorcrafting if certain magical effects are desired. Hides and webbing are usually used to make light or medium armor.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/fang-cyan}{Fangs \& Claws}{}
Nearly every monster has these, but they are the first thing to be damaged in a fight and likely to be worn even before it has started. For crafting, only undamaged fangs and claws are useful. Besides crafting weapons, fangs and claws are frequently used as part of charms or decoration on armor.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/sac-yellow}{Sacs}{}
Sacs are glands that some monsters have developed to produce their special defenses, such as flammable liquid or venom. If they can be removed undamaged and before everything inside has been expended, they can be very useful. Even empty, some can be used as part of a magical enchantment.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/monster-jewel-red}{Gems}{}
The most sought after prize after defeating a wyvern is without question a wyvern gem. Unique to each species of wyvern, they are similar to pearls, forming in the digestive tract of the wyvern. Only very few wyvern form one, however, so these remain among the rarest trophies a hunter can obtain. If one manages, however, they are not only beautiful to look at but also extremely powerful magical catalysts and highly valuable.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/egg-white}{Eggs}{}
There is not much publically available information on the usefulness of the eggs of large wyverns. The gathering of wyvern eggs is a practice that is not only extremely dangerous, as the wyvern will protect them fiercely, but also forbidden by the Guild. When the Guild issues a quest to hunt a monster, that contract does not extend to the monster's offspring. In keeping with the Guild's tenet of \emph{life as a community}, the gathering of large wyvern eggs is considered poaching (no pun intended).


\section{Other Materials}
In addition to monster materials, other, naturally occuring items may be used in the creation of weapons, armor and other items as well as in alchemy and cooking.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/herb-green}{Herbs}{And mushrooms~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/mushroom-cyan}}
There is a huge variety of useful herbs and mushrooms, if one knows where to find them. Many are seasonal, hard to find or grow only in extreme conditions. A skilled herbalist can make a comfortable living simply because some herbs are quite valuable owing to the difficulty of obtaining them.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/fish-cyan}{Fish}{}
While not typically useful for crafting or alchemy, fish are a common source of food and some have other, surprising usefulness, such as the whetfish~\smallicon{assets/ext/icons/fish-yellow} whose rough scales can be used to sharpen weapons.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/ore-orange}{Ores}{}
The people of the ancient civilisation were the true masters of working different types of ore. While much of their handiwork has been destroyed, what remains shows a degree of craftsmanship that today's society can only hope to match. Nevertheless, the field of metallurgy is advancing rapidly and new methods of working and extracting metal are being found nearly every day, perhaps even some that not even the ancients thought of. The center of innovation of these advances are mining towns and knowledge spreads only slowly outwards from these places, so not every village blacksmith will know how to work the more exotic metals.

\end{hbFancyWideTable}

\section{Food}

While many hunters have different rituals on what to do before embarking on a hunt, it is well known that a good meal before a hunt is very important. So important even, that a good cook is considered indispensable for any hunting caravan or expedition. A skilled cook can prepare a variety of foods appropriate to the situation to lift spirits and the hunters the strength they need to keep up the hunt. Even better if the cook is a hunter themself, so the party can continue to be supplied with good food in the field.

In addition to being nutritious, meals provide small, temporary effects. Any creature can only benefit from one meal effect between long rests. Eating a second meal before taking a long rest will not provide any bonus. Meal effects last until they are depleted (for example, temporary hit points are used up), are used up (for limited use effects) or the user takes a long rest, though they last for 24 hours at most. Not just any food will do to get an effect, though! Only food prepared by a skilled cook and made with the right ingredients will count for these effects.

The effects and foods given here are not the only ones, and you are encouraged to invent your own!

\section{Special Weapons and Armor}
So you've done it, you've slain your first Rathalos and are probably not feeling quite good about yourself right now, but are also wondering what to do with the scales, bones, claws, wings, spikes and other parts of the beast that you've carved off for yourself. You may also have found yourself in the posession of some rare ore or another and are wondering what it could possibly be good for.

The thing about hunting monsters is: There is always a bigger fish. No matter if you've just bested Rathalos or even the mighty Rajang, there is always a tougher monster out there. And to face it, you will have to come with the proper equipment. The usual thing to do is to make it out of the bodyparts of the monster you've just slain. But weapons and armor from monster parts or rare ores does more than offer protection, it also allows your gear to be imbued with a variety of magical effects.

\imageheader{assets/ext/iconsL/helm-blue}{Velociprey Mask}{Made from \tableicon{carapace-blue}\,Velocidrome Head\\Requires Attunement}
\textit{A mask made to resemble the face of a Velociprey. Feels as if it has a soul.}

While wearing to this terrifying mask, you have proficiency with the intimidation skill. You have disadvantage on all charisma checks that aren't intimidation. In addition, when you take the attack action, you may perform a leaping attack and jump up to 20 feet before performing the first attack. This does not count against your movement allowance for the turn. Once you have used this ability, you may not use it again until you finish or short or long rest.

\section{Weapon and Armor Enchantments}
In addition to the specific weapons and armor described above, a number of generic enchantments are available, which can be active on equipment of different types and from different monsters. You can use this list of enchantments for inspiration on designing your own equipment that you want to craft.

Generally speaking, gear made from metals will be receptive to enchantment by a craftsman who is skilled in such magic. Equipment made from monster parts will carry the innate properties of the monster from which it came. In either case, it means that not every enchantment will necessarily be available to you whenever you want it. Speak to your DM about what you can craft out of the items you have and the craftsmen who are at hand, as well as what materials are required.

\chapter{The Wilderness}
\hbWideBottomArtFirstPage{1.98}{.892}{assets/ext/egg-hunt}
The wilderness comes in many different kinds, from scorching deserts to humid jungles and freezing tundras. Monsters thrive in every biome, from lush plains to extremes like volcanoes or the depths of the ocean. What follows is a description of the basic terrain types, corresponding to the ranger's favored terrain types: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, underground and as a new addition: underwater.

\subsubsection{Foraging}
A hunting party travelling through the wilderness will often have to forage for food or gather materials for crafting. Rather than treat this as a bookkeeping exercise or a gruelling survival scenario, I prefer to treat this as an opportunity for hijinks and adventure. Nevertheless, the rules for wilderness survival from the \DMG{} apply: Each character needs one pound of food and one gallon of water per day to stay healthy.

You can forage for food while you travel, so long as you are travelling at slow or medium pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region.

\begin{hbNarrowTable}{Foraging DCs}{YC}
\textbf{Food and Water Availability} & \textbf{DC}\\
Abundant food and water sources & 10\\
Limited food and water sources & 15\\
Very little, if any, food and water sources & 20
\end{hbNarrowTable}

If multiple characters forage, each character makes a seperate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check (and may run into trouble, such as a random encounter). On a successful check, roll 1d6+the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in gallons).

\subsubsection{Hunting}
In order to hunt for food, a character must hunt for at least 4 hours, which cannot be done while travelling. Roll on the following chart to see if any prey is found. If you have proficiency with the Survival skill, this roll is with advantage. Then refer to the section about the terrain type to roll what you found.

\begin{hbNarrowTable}{Hunting DCs}{YC}
\textbf{Terrain Type} & \textbf{DC}\\
Forest & 10\\
Grassland & 10\\
Coast & 12\\
Underwater & 12\\
Swamp & 13\\
Mountain & 15\\
Underground & 18\\
Desert & 20\\
Arctic & 20
\end{hbNarrowTable}

\hbWideBottomArtFirstPageFix

\subsubsection{Mining}
In order to mine ores, a character must mine for at least 4 hours, which cannot be done while travelling. Roll on the following chart to see if any ore is found. If you have proficiency with the Survival skill, this roll is with advantage. Then refer to the section about the terrain type to roll what you found. If you are proficient in the Survival skill, you add your proficiency modifier to the roll.

\begin{hbNarrowTable}{Mining DCs}{YC}
\textbf{Terrain Type} & \textbf{DC}\\
Underground & 10\\
Mountain & 10\\
Desert & 12\\
Coast & 13\\
Arctic & 13\\
Grassland & 15\\
Forest & 15\\
Underwater & 18\\
Swamp & 20\\
\end{hbNarrowTable}

\subsubsection{Fishing}
In order to catch fish, you must spend at least 4 hours fishing, which cannot be done while travelling. If you have fishing equipment, make a DC\,12 Wisdom (Survival) check. If you have excellent bait, you have advantage on this check. On a success, consult the table below to see what you caught. You cannot fish underwater, use the rules for hunting instead. Not every fish is good to eat!

\section{Forest}
The forest biome covers temperate and arctic forests, such as the ones found all over Goldora and Fonlon, as well as jungles, such as the ones in Aya. In the forests of the world, the battle for survival is at its fiercest, as neither raw strength or great speed will be enough to ensure survival. Despite the dense monster population of forests, many roads are built to lead through them, as the trees can provide cover from aerial wyverns.

Many misteries are hidden deep within impenetrable forests, both natural and artificial, both ancient and new.

\end{hbNarrowTable}

\section{Grassland}
Grasslands exist in different climates, in the tropical savannas south of Arcolis, the temperate hills of Schrade or the cold tundras of Akra. In order to survive here, a monster must either be large enough to be hard to kill, or very fast, to escape predators, as there is barely any place to hide. There are not many roads leading through grasslands, as a caravan travelling through such an open area would be too exposed.

Some of the greatest marvels of the ancient civilisation can be found out on the plains. The monuments that they have left can sometimes be seen from a dozen miles away.
